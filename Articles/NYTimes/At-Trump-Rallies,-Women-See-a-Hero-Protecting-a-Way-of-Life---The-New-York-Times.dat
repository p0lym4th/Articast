COLUMBIA, Mo. \u2014 Standing in an airplane hangar in the mid-autumn chill awaiting the arrival of President Trump, Joan Philpott said she was angry and scared. Only Mr. Trump, she said, can solve the problems she worries most about.\u201cHe wants to protect this country, and he wants to keep it safe, and he wants to keep it free of invaders and the caravan and everything else that\u2019s going on,\u201d said Ms. Philpott, 69, a retired respiratory therapist.Ms. Philpott was one of thousands of women who braved a drizzle for hours to have the chance to cheer Mr. Trump at a rally here on Thursday. While political strategists and public opinion experts agree that Mr. Trump\u2019s greatest electoral weakness is among female voters, here in Columbia and places like it, the president enjoys a herolike status among women who say he is fighting to preserve a way of life threatened by an increasingly liberal Democratic Party.\u201cHe understands why we\u2019re angry,\u201d Ms. Philpott said, \u201cand he wants to fix it.\u201dAs Republican candidates battle to keep their congressional majorities in the midterm elections on Tuesday, Mr. Trump is crisscrossing the country to deliver a closing argument meant to acknowledge \u2014 and in many cases stoke \u2014 women\u2019s anxieties. At rally after rally, he has said that women \u201cwant security,\u201d warning of encroaching immigrants, rising crime and a looming economic downturn if Democrats gain power.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s female backers initially supported him only reluctantly or do so now in spite of reservations about his bawdy language and erratic behavior. But they shared in his victory after the bitter and partisan battle over the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. And many believe the president when he reminds them during each of his hourlong pep rallies that the world they know \u2014 largely Christian, conservative and white \u2014 is at stake on Tuesday.\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m nervous about it,\u201d Amy Kremer, a Tea Party activist and the co-founder of the Women for Trump PAC, said of the election, which is widely viewed as a referendum on Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this energy and momentum for a midterm, but also the polls weren\u2019t correct in 2016.\u201dMs. Kremer said she and the other women in her Atlanta-area social circle \u201clove\u201d Mr. Trump, adding, \u201cWe like when somebody promises to do something and they follow through on it.\u201dBut that warmth toward the president is decidedly a minority view among women around the country, and Republican officials fret privately that Mr. Trump\u2019s harder-edged messages will alienate the women the party needs to preserve vital seats.Women disproportionately opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s election two years ago, and have turned against him in even greater numbers since, an ominous sign for members of his party.Anna Greenberg, a managing partner of the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s dark view of immigration, articulated in a racist video posted to his Twitter account and several fiery speeches, was likely to repel suburban and educated women.\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to believe we aren\u2019t going to have an enormous gender gap, particularly driven by suburban women,\u201d Ms. Greenberg said in an interview.Yet days before the midterm elections, women are streaming into the president\u2019s campaign events wearing bedazzled hats and T-shirts proclaiming Mr. Trump\u2019s greatness. In between the selections from the musical \u201cCats,\u201d the Celine Dion ballads and the Elton John classics that fill out the president\u2019s campaign soundtrack, they hoist hot-pink \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d signs as they balance babies on their hips. And they scoff at the suggestion that Mr. Trump \u2014 who has been accused of sexual assault and boasted graphically that he could do \u201canything\u201d with women \u2014 has a problem with them.\u201cI get a kick out of it,\u201d said Misty Spencer-Sauer, 40, a stay-at-home mother from Blackwater, Mo., who drove more than an hour to attend the Columbia rally with her father and fianc\xe9. \u201cI just sit and yell at my TV, because they twist around what he says and it\u2019s, like, everybody\u2019s so sensitive all the time. He may be blunt, but I can take it.\u201dLike Ms. Philpott, many of the women expressed a vague anxiety about an economic downturn if Republicans lose. But it is their visceral fear of immigrants and raw anger about changes in cultural mores \u2014 encapsulated by what they called Democrats\u2019 rush to believe uncorroborated allegations of sexual assault by Justice Kavanaugh \u2014 that appear to be driving the intensity of their support for the president.\u201cUnbelievable what they could do to a man over politics,\u201d said Diana Bass, a small-business owner from Kenna, W.Va. \u201cIf it could happen to him, it could happen to you.\u201dMs. Bass, who attended Mr. Trump\u2019s rally Friday afternoon in Huntington, W.Va., said she believed the president\u2019s claims that the migrant caravan heading toward the United States from Central America was being funded by American liberals \u2014 probably, she said, by George Soros, the Jewish billionaire who has been the target of conspiracy theorists for weeks.Women like Ms. Bass, who was decked out in Trump memorabilia at the rally, are the people the president has in mind when he boasts about how popular he is with female voters. \u201cThey keep saying I\u2019m not doing well with women \u2014 they said it before the last election,\u201d Mr. Trump said here on Thursday. \u201cThen, when the election was over, they said: \u2018You know what? He did great with women.\u2019\u201dThe president did not, in fact, do great with women. While he often claims that 52 percent of women supported him, that was the proportion of white women who did so; over all, 41 percent of women backed him in the presidential election. Since 2016, women have grown only more skeptical of him. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 38 percent of women approved of the job he was doing, substantially below the 47 percent it recorded over all, and 58 percent of women disapproved.But Mr. Trump has not tempered his tone, instead betting that his fear-based appeals will resonate with women. \u201cBorder security is very much a woman\u2019s issue,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Saturday afternoon in Belgrade, Mont. \u201cWomen want security. They don\u2019t want that caravan.\u201dThat is certainly the case for Kristin Sellers, 48, of Pace, Fla., who said she was \u201canxious as hell\u201d about the migrants, and trusted Mr. Trump to keep them out.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I agree with everything that comes out of his mouth, because like his wife, I\u2019d like to take his phone from him, but I just felt that we needed someone with a business sense to get our country back on track, and that\u2019s what Trump has done,\u201d Ms. Sellers said as she waited for Mr. Trump in an airplane hangar in Pensacola, Fla., on Saturday.Some of the women who are backing him were not sure two years ago that they wanted him to be president.Ms. Spencer-Sauer said she \u201cstruggled\u201d briefly to decide whether to support Hillary Clinton, reflecting on the history-making milestone her election would set. But when Mr. Trump won the Republican primary, her doubts were erased.Her love of Mr. Trump has created a rift with her 20-year-old daughter, who bawled on election night in 2016, Ms. Spencer-Sauer said, grinning as she recalled the suck-it-up response she offered: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what to tell you, dear, but he won.\u201dMeifang Wang, 54, a cardiovascular researcher at the University of Missouri, also sparred with her children about her support for Mr. Trump, an argument that they won in 2016, when they persuaded her on Election Day to stay home rather than vote for him.\u201cI regret it,\u201d she said, calling Mr. Trump \u201clike a father for this country.\u201dMs. Wang, who immigrated from China in 1990 and voted for President Barack Obama twice, said Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh tone and policies toward immigrants did not bother her.\u201cYou guys think it\u2019s not very humanitarian, but he\u2019s doing the right thing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe work hard and pay our taxes, and they\u2019re living life as freeloaders \u2014 I call them freeloaders.\u201dMs. Wang was one of many women interviewed over the past week who spoke of Mr. Trump as a paternal, benevolent figure. They smiled and shook their heads as if dismissing the antics of a beloved uncle when asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s callous remarks and erratic behavior.\u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him for his character,\u201d said Charlene Brown, 57, a real estate agent from Indianapolis who attended the president\u2019s rally there on Friday. \u201cI voted for him for his positions.\u201dRachell Marks, 59, who works in car sales in Billings, Mont., said she would continue to support Mr. Trump because she believed he told the truth.\u201cI have an infatuation and a love for this man that\u2019s not normal,\u201d Ms. Marks said. \u201cI give the highest respect when people are telling the truth and giving their political power. If anything, I have a deeper respect now.\u201dOf Mr. Trump\u2019s previous visit to Montana, when in the wake of a Saudi journalist\u2019s killing he praised a congressman for body-slamming a reporter, Ms. Marks said with a shrug: \u201cPeople tend to get on people\u2019s nerves.\u201d
