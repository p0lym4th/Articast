ALBERT LEA, Minn. \u2014 The Republican attack ads targeting George Soros and Colin Kaepernick were the first to arrive in southern Minnesota last month, so closely echoing President Trump that he could have written them himself.Then came the caravan.This latest ad \u2014 part of a multimillion-dollar blitz from Republican groups in this battleground House district \u2014 warns of \u201ca caravan full of illegal immigrants marching on America,\u201d bringing with it \u201cgang members and criminals.\u201d Grainy video shows Latin American men pumping fists in the air.As Republicans scramble ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election to try to save their majorities in the House and Senate, many party officials and candidates like Jim Hagedorn, the nominee here in Minnesota\u2019s First District, have concluded that their best shot at victory is embracing the Trump political playbook of demonization.The goal \u2014 through overt, frontal attacks on prominent liberals, minorities and immigrants \u2014 is to stoke an us vs. them narrative about the country\u2019s security, culture and heritage, in hopes of getting conservatives to see the election as a battle to save the nation\u2019s future.Beyond rural Minnesota, in districts across Ohio and New York, Republicans believe the strategy is resonating, and may help them win some races Tuesday as their 23-seat majority comes under attack.Mr. Hagedorn is making his fourth run for the seat, and was once widely regarded as a weak candidate because of a long record of sexist and insensitive remarks about a number of minority groups \u2014 the conservative Washington Examiner called him \u201cthe worst Republican candidate in America.\u201d Yet polling indicates a tight race, giving the G.O.P. one of its few decent chances of flipping a Democratic-held seat this year.Republicans are also defending dozens of other seats that the party now holds, but they are finding that in many places the Trump playbook can go only so far before it backfires.In the affluent, educated suburbs where much of the political battleground is, Republicans are framing immigration less as a cultural issue with implications for the country\u2019s identity and more as a question of security by drawing attention to sanctuary cities, which limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials, and MS-13, the violent transnational gang.In the handful of more rural, conservative-leaning districts where the party has a better shot of winning, the message is blunter.In Minnesota, ads from groups like the Congressional Leadership Fund and the National Republican Congressional Committee try to link Mr. Hagedorn\u2019s opponent, Dan Feehan, to people and themes that conservatives have portrayed as a threat, like Mr. Soros, the liberal philanthropist who has been smeared with anti-Semitic attacks; Mr. Kaepernick, the black football player famous for kneeling during the national anthem; and now the migrant caravan.In one, a doctored image appears to show Mr. Feehan, an Army veteran, saluting Mr. Kaepernick. Another shows Mr. Kaepernick alongside two other favorite villains of conservatives \u2014 Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, and Keith Ellison, the Minnesota congressman who is black and Muslim and is now facing abuse allegations as he runs for state attorney general. Mr. Feehan\u2019s face appears on the screen, and the announcer intones, \u201cHe\u2019s one of them.\u201dAds like these have aired repeatedly across the district\u2019s 12,000 square miles of farmland and small towns, making it what Republicans say is the most active political laboratory for the bald appeals to white racial and cultural anxieties that President Trump and many Republicans are using to drive conservatives to the polls.The First District, which is 90 percent white, fits the demographic profile of many of the places where Mr. Trump has been confined to campaigning by Republicans who do not want him in more diverse districts. Given Mr. Trump\u2019s self-described \u201cnationalist\u201d views, some Republicans believe their path to staying in power in the Trump era is increasingly narrow and heavily dependent on the parts of the country that are the most white and rural.Jason Hulburt, a production line supervisor from Albert Lea, said he planned to vote for Mr. Hagedorn on Tuesday, a choice he made in part because of how important he thinks it is for Mr. Trump to have like-minded Republicans in Congress.\u201cDonald Trump knows what he wants, and the Democrats are afraid of the issues Trump talks about,\u201d he said Friday night as he finished a brandy and water at Eddie\u2019s, a local bar. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid to offend certain people. Trump is not afraid.\u201dRepublican strategists argued that such pinpoint tactics worked for Mr. Trump in 2016 and could work again.\u201cThey are going to all the right places,\u201d said Scott Reed, the chief political strategist for the United States Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThat\u2019s what has me optimistic. The president\u2019s energy level and where they land the plane could be the difference on Election Day.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s playbook represents an extraordinary break with recent Republican presidents like the Bushes and nominees like Mitt Romney and John McCain. They sought to grow the party with appeals, however limited, to Hispanic voters, women and culturally conservative immigrants.Mr. Trump, who promised after his victory in 2016 to be a president for \u201call Americans,\u201d has been fixated this year on visiting states that were critical to his Electoral College win and doubling down on nurturing his homogeneous base in those places. Many Republicans privately worry that in terms of the future health of their party, the outreach and agenda they are pursuing feels a lot like the president\u2019s travel footprint: provincial and small.\u201cNo one has repealed the long-term demographic trends in the country,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a prominent Republican pollster. \u201cAt some point, Republicans are going to have to reach out beyond the base if they hope to win a majority of the popular vote in the future.\u201dWhen Air Force One touched down in West Virginia on Friday, for instance, it was Mr. Trump\u2019s eighth visit to the state that delivered him his largest share of the vote anywhere \u2014 68 percent \u2014 and in a congressional district that is 93 percent white. The districts he plans to visit through Monday night have very similar compositions: Indiana\u2019s Third District around Fort Wayne is 83 percent white, while Tennessee\u2019s Third in Chattanooga is 82 percent white.Even on his trips over the last few days to Florida, a state that is 45 percent nonwhite, Mr. Trump held his rally in a district near Fort Myers (70 percent white) and one encompassing Pensacola (73 percent).The president visited Minnesota\u2019s First last month to campaign for Mr. Hagedorn. Through a spokesman, Mr. Hagedorn declined to be interviewed.At his rallies lately Mr. Trump has laid out a clear, if misleading, picture of what Democratic control of Congress would look like. It includes, in no particular order, \u201ccaravan after caravan\u201d; crime; chaos; sanctuary cities; \u201cbirth tourism,\u201d where immigrants can have children who are automatically citizens; and an empowered and emboldened Maxine Waters, the black Democratic congresswoman he has often insulted as \u201clow I.Q.\u201dA vote for Republicans, by contrast, he said the other night at a rally in central Missouri, represents greatness; \u201cstanding up for our national anthem\u201d; more jobs; and the promise \u201cto win, win, win.\u201dThe math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.In interviews, his supporters rejected any suggestion that Mr. Trump traffics in racist or divisive views, saying that the issues the president raised were merely matters of law and order and made good fiscal sense.\u201cWe are a nation of immigrants, but we are a nation of laws, too,\u201d said Stan Hale of Oakville, Mo., who drove two hours for the Trump rally in Columbia on Thursday night. \u201cThe other side is so fake when they talk about the little guy, the working class. They don\u2019t care. They only care about votes.\u201dHis wife, Melita, insisted: \u201cRace has nothing to do with it. Race doesn\u2019t even enter the mind.\u201d For her the issue with immigrants was \u201cvetting,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who they are. You just don\u2019t know.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s narrower approach, compared with past Republican leaders, is especially evident in his travel schedule. During the final month before the midterm elections of 1990 and 2002, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush traveled to far more states than Mr. Trump has, according to data compiled by Brendan Doherty, a political scientist at the United States Naval Academy.\u201cThe big difference with his travel,\u201d said Mr. Doherty, \u201cis President Trump has been spending more time in states that he won quite comfortably.\u201dThe elder Mr. Bush visited 20 states between Oct. 1 and Election Day in 1990; the younger Mr. Bush went to 29 states over the same period in his first term. Strategists familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s plans said that as of Monday, the president had visited 19 states since Labor Day, which was two months ago.Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal is already more limited than any other modern chief executive\u2019s, a worrisome fact for Republicans who fear that he will leave the party in a woefully uncompetitive position whenever he leaves office. No president in the history of Gallup\u2019s polling has averaged as low an approval rating as he has during the first two years in office. And he is the only president whose approval in Gallup\u2019s surveys has never exceeded 50 percent at this point into the first term, even for a brief period of time.Even one of the polling statistics Mr. Trump is proudest of \u2014 his approval rating among Republicans, which has been near 90 percent for months \u2014 is not quite what it seems.Americans who identify as Republicans are the smallest part of the electorate, currently below 30 percent, public opinion surveys from Gallup, the Pew Research Center and others show.\u201cHaving 90 percent of the smallest party ID in the country is not necessarily something to brag about,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. \u201cAnd any way you look at it,\u201d she added, \u201cTrump is not in control of a big piece of the electorate.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.One thing the midterm elections will be a test of is whether the most vocal and active slice of Mr. Trump\u2019s voters \u2014 a minority of a minority \u2014 can swing close elections after two years of a chaotic presidency. Mr. Hagedorn and his campaign staff hope that is the case.Gregg Peppin, a consultant working for Mr. Hagedorn, recalled an exchange he witnessed Mr. Hagedorn have at a McDonald\u2019s on Friday morning.\u201cJim went up to a table of five guys and a woman,\u201d Mr. Peppin said. \u201cAnd the first words out of the guy\u2019s mouth was, \u2018What are you going to do about the caravan?\u2019\u201d
