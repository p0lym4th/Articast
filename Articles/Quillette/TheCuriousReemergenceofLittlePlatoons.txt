“What does your part of the country think about what’s happening in Washington, D.C. right now?” a man in his mid sixties read aloud from a sheet of paper to the group of six Republicans and six Democrats.
I had just arrived at the small, split-level home in a wooded neighborhood in Bloomington, Indiana—miffed by the uncommon, light-to-medium traffic that had delayed my arrival from Indianapolis—and hurriedly joined a group of twelve seated in a circle. This was a Better Angels workshop, one of hundreds of such gatherings happening in communities across the country, which aims to unify a deeply divided nation.
.@BetterAngelsUSA is helping initiate dialogue and understanding between #democrats and #republicans all across the country — even at St. Olaf. Current Oles can email siems1@stolaf.edu to participate in a campus red/blue workshop on October 6, 1-4pm. https://t.co/zqjQguFee7
